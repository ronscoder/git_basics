While GitHub gives us a nice UI for editing files, committing a change in their UI has the same effect on the remote repository that modifying a file locally and then using git add and git commit does on our local repo. Once again, we're editing files directly on GitHub for purposes of this book only, as this is something you rarely want to do in real projects.
